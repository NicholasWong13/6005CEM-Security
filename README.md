Introduction: 
The project is focused on developing a hair salon website with the title named Studio C Hair & Beauty Salon which can deal with customer’s enquiries and reviews, order processing, stock control and marketing. It will enable customers to view the time-to-time promotion displayed at the homepage. Besides that, customers can make appointments online via the website. The website also allows customers to send feedback to the salon. For instance, sending an overall rating of the salon’s services. Lastly, the information of the customers will be stored in the database and admin can view them through the admin panel.
